============================================================
🚨 SCENARIO: Normal Traffic Flow - Downtown
============================================================
📍 Segment: SEG001_Downtown_Main
🚗 Current Speed: 45.2 km/h (Expected: 50.0 km/h)
🚙 Vehicle Count: 12
📅 Time: 2024-01-15 14:30:25

🤖 Asking Gemini AI to analyze...

📋 GEMINI AI ANALYSIS:
----------------------------------------
## Traffic Analysis

**Congestion Assessment:** Light congestion detected
- Speed reduction: 9.6% below expected
- Vehicle density: Low (12 vehicles)
- Confidence: High (95%)

**Contributing Factors:**
- Non-rush hour timing
- Downtown location with typical urban flow
- No significant external events detected

**Recommendations:**
1. [LOW] Continue standard monitoring protocols
2. [LOW] Maintain current signal timing
3. [PREVENTIVE] Monitor for developing patterns

**Expected Outcomes:** Maintain current flow efficiency

============================================================
📊 ANALYSIS SUMMARY
============================================================
🚦 Congestion Level: 🟢 LIGHT
📈 Speed Reduction: 9.6%
🎯 AI Confidence: 95%
⚡ Response Time: <30 seconds
🤖 Intelligence: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash
